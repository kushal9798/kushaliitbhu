Twitter is an online microblogging tool that promulgate more than 400 million messages per day. SemEval-2018 Task1 has been presented and explored named “Affect in Tweets” in many existing research works. In this research article, we come up with deep learning architecture which is extremely coherent for sentiment analysis, it has lack of inadequacy labeled data in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). To solve this issue deep learning techniques has been used as deep learning models are productive due to their automatic learning capability and automatic feature extraction. This Research Paper highlights the implementation of deep learning models such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, LSTM and many more. Twelve different label classes label data has been taken from English tweets. The tasks are -: 1. emotion intensity regression, 2. emotion intensity ordinal classification, 3. emotion classification. We have expressed that the fine-grained intensity scores that we have obtained are reliable (repeat annotations may result in similar scores). Our tweet-based dataset is beneficial for testing supervised machine learning algorithms for multi-label classification, intensity regression, sleuthing ordinal category of intensity of feeling (low, moderate, etc.). We have implemented various machine learning and deep learning models achieved accuracy of 77.64% using E-oc (Emotion ordinal classification).
